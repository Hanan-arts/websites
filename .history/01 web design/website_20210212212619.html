And these 50 inspiring quotes about books and reading are here to remind you of that.

“Show me a family of readers, and I will show you the people who move the world.” – Napoleon Bonaparte

“A book is a garden, an orchard, a storehouse, a party, a company by the way, a counselor, a multitude of
counselors.” – Charles Baudelaire
