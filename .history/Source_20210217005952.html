<h4>ACTION AND ADVENTURE</h4>
<p>Action and adventure books constantly have you on the
edge of your seat with excitement, as your fave main
character repeatedly finds themselves in high stakes 
situations. The protagonist has an ultimate goal to achieve
and is always put in risky, often dangerous situations.
This genre typically crosses over with others like mystery, crime, 
sci-fi, and fantasy. (Harry Potter anyone?)</p>
<h4>CLASSICS</h4>
<p>You may think of these books as the throwback readings
you were assigned in English class. (Looking at you, Charles Dickens.)
The classics have been around for decades, and were often groundbreaking
stories at their publish time, but have continued to be impactful for generations, 
serving as the foundation for many popular works we read today.</p>
<h4>COMIC BOOK AND GRAPHIC NOVEL</h4>
<p>The stories in comic books and graphic novels are presented to the reader through engaging,
sequential narrative art (illustrations and typography) that's either presented in a 
specific design or the traditional panel layout you find in comics. With both, you'll 
often find the dialogue presented in the tell-tale "word balloons" 
next to the respective characters.</p>
<h4>DETECTIVE AND MYSTERY</h4>
<p>The plot always revolves around a crime of sorts that must be solved—or foiled—by the 
protagonists.

</p>
<h4>FANTASY</h4>
<p>While usually set in a fictional imagined world—in opposition, Ta-Nehisi's Coates's 
The Water Dancer takes place in the very real world of American slavery—fantasy 
books include prominent elements of magic, mythology, or the supernatural.</p>
<h4>HISTORICAL FICTION</h4>
<p>these books are based in a time period set in the past decades, 
    often against the backdrop of significant (real) historical events.</p>
    <h4>HORROR</h4>
    <P>Meant to cause discomfort and fear for both the character and readers, horror writers often make use of supernatural and paranormal elements in morbid stories
         that are sometimes a little too realistic. The master of horror fiction?</P>
