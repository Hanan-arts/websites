<h1><b>BOOKS</b></h1>
<p>A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of
many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.
The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of
hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its
predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.

As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes
a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read.
In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, 
a usage that reflects the fact that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and
each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. Each part of Aristotle's Physics is called a
book. 
In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books 
or chapters or parts, 
are parts.

<p><b></b><h1>10 BEST BOOKS OF THE 21ST CENTURY</h1></p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>I FEEL BAD ABOUT MY NECK     </b> <i>BY NORA EPHRON(2006)
                <p>Perhaps better known for her screenwriting (Silkwood, When Harry Met Sally, Heartburn),
                Ephron’s brand of smart theatrical humour is on best display in her essays. Confiding and 
            self-deprecating, she has a way of always managing to sound like your best friend – even when 
            writing about her apartment on New York’s Upper West Side. This wildly enjoyable collection includes
            her droll observations about ageing, vanity – 
                    and a scorching appraisal of Bill Clinton.</p>
