<h1><b>BOOKS</b></h1>
<p>A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of
many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.
The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of
hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its
predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.

As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes
a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read.
In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, 
a usage that reflects the fact that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and
each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. Each part of Aristotle's Physics is called a
book. 
In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books 
or chapters or parts, 
are parts.

<p><b></b><h1>10 BEST BOOKS OF THE 21ST CENTURY</h1></p>
<p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>I FEEL BAD ABOUT MY NECK     </b> <i>BY NORA EPHRON(2006)
                <p>Perhaps better known for her screenwriting (Silkwood, When Harry Met Sally, Heartburn),
                Ephron’s brand of smart theatrical humour is on best display in her essays. Confiding and 
            self-deprecating, she has a way of always managing to sound like your best friend – even when 
            writing about her apartment on New York’s Upper West Side. This wildly enjoyable collection includes
            her droll observations about ageing, vanity – 
                    and a scorching appraisal of Bill Clinton.</p>

                    <li><b>THE GIRL WITH A DRAGON TATTO   </b><I>BY STIEG LARSSON (2005),TRANSLATED BY STEVEN T MURRAY(2008)</I><p>Radical journalist Mikael Blomkvist
                        forms an unlikely alliance with troubled young hacker Lisbeth Salander as they follow a trail of
                murder and malfeasance connected with one of Sweden’s most powerful families in the first novel of
                    the bestselling Millennium trilogy. The high-level intrigue beguiled millions of readers, 
                        brought “Scandi noir” to prominence and inspired innumerable copycats.</p>

        <li><b>BROKEN GLASS  </b><i>BY ALAIN MABANCKOU(2005),TRANSLATED BY HELEN STEVENSON(2009)
            <p>The Congolese writer says he was “trying to break the French language” with Broken Glass –
            a black comedy told by a disgraced teacher without much in the way of full stops or paragraph breaks. 
            As Mabanckou’s unreliable narrator munches his “bicycle chicken” and drinks his red wine, it becomes
                clear he has the history of Congo-Brazzaville and
                the whole of French literature in his sights.</p>
                <li><b>HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE </b><i>BY JK ROWLING(2000)</i></li><P>A generation grew up on Rowling’s
            all-conquering magical fantasies, but countless adults have also been enthralled by her immersive.
            Book four, the first of the doorstoppers, marks the point where the series really takes off.
            The Triwizard Tournament provides pace and tension, and Rowling makes her boy wizard look death
            in the eye for the first time.</P>
