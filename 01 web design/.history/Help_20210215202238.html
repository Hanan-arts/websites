<p>“You won’t understand what I mean now, but someday you will: the only trick of friendship,
I think, is to find people who are better than you are—not smarter, not cooler, but kinder,
and more generous, and more forgiving—and then to appreciate them for what they can teach 
you, and to try to listen to them when they tell you something about yourself, no matter
how bad—or good—it might be, and to trust them, which is the hardest thing of all. But 
the best, as well.”
    ― Hanya Yanagihara, A Little Life</p>
